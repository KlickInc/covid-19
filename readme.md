# PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRELY:
At Klick, we’re very proud that our business values have always included a ‘People First’ mentality.  Because of this, we’re taking extraordinary precautions due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation.
 
With COVID-19 quickly spreading throughout the world, and with so much yet to understand, we wanted to take a moment to let you know the proactive steps we’re taking to ensure our team’s safety. This document reflects our best knowledge at the time of writing and it will be continually updated to incorporate new learnings as they surface.  
 
Beyond general hygiene such as frequent HANDWASHING and not touching your face is one of the best ways to minimize transmission. In addition, social distancing is seen by public health authorities as a key method of reducing risk. As such, we have implemented a number of policies that will help us leverage this proven technique. Some of these include the minimization of travel and large gatherings amongst team members and clients.  
 
If you are not feeling well, you *MUST* work from home. We are elevating our safety precautions. Please carefully read through the guidelines on Levels 1 through 9 and their respective policy changes itemized below. In addition, we expect you to stay home for a minimum of two weeks after all symptoms have dissipated. 
 
We know that social distancing may also impact us in our personal lives with the potential for school closures and/or or transit reductions. Although these issues can be challenging for any business, we feel that Klick is in a unique position to minimize these issues by leaning into our digitally centric heritage.  
 
As the situation warrants, we want to build increasing readiness and adoption of virtual technologies to better enable remote work. 

The good news is that many Klicksters are seasoned veterans when it comes to virtual collaboration. We are currently working to make sure that we have the right infrastructure, knowledge, and best practices needed to ensure our success and continuity of operations.  
 
In the document below, you’ll find our latest thinking with respect to how we will continue to adapt our practices to ensure we’re able to continue to deliver against our clients’ expectations, while also making every decision in a manner that’s thoughtfully prioritizing the safety of our team. We ask that you also make responsible decisions in your personal life, avoiding concerts, sporting events, and other large public gatherings. 
 
Of course, we will monitor this situation and will amend and adjust this policy at regular intervals as this situation develops. We thank you for your understanding and patience. These levels are not necessarily sequential, but specific levels would be automatically triggered if specific events such as school closures or removal of public transportation. That said, we are already encouraging people to shift all meetings to virtual where possible, as well as work from home, as much as possible.

# Safety Guidelines for COVID-19

## Level 1 (Standard Operations)
-	Vigilant monitoring of any risk to the safety of our team.
-	Consistent use of healthy hygiene habits and practices to prevent the spread of flu and other respiratory illnesses  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/actions-prevent-flu.htm
  -	*Avoid close contact.* Keep your distance from people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
  -	*Stay home when you are sick.* Stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. This will help prevent spreading your illness to others.
  -	*Cover your mouth and nose.* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Flu and other serious respiratory illnesses, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), whooping cough, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are spread by cough, sneezing, or unclean hands.
  -	*Clean your hands.* Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
  -	*Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.* Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.
  -	*Practice other good health and wellness habits.* Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work, or school, especially when someone is ill. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food.

## Level 2 (Restricted Travel)
-	On February 3, 2020, Klick introduced travel restrictions to CDC hot spots and rolled out our first set of measures in response to COVID-19. 

## Level 3 (Escalated Precautions)
-	Travel:
  -	February 22, 2020: we revised our policies 
  -	February 29, 2020: we escalated our precautions and changed policies, eliminating all non-essential travel 
-	Efforts to maintain sanitary and safe workspaces for Klicksters continue, including increased cleaning of office surfaces and the provision of hand sanitizers and wipes in various locations around the office.
 
## Level 4 (Validating Continuity Planning)
-	Travel Policy Revisions:
  -	March 1, 2020: Eliminated all travel outside North America, beyond CDC hot spots
  -	March 3, 2020: 
  -*	Eliminated conference travel and participation
  -*	Eliminated offsite-related travel
  -*	Eliminated inter-office travel (Canada & USA)
  -*	Request that any critical travel be explicitly approved in advance, even within the US. Klick will not provide a definition of essential travel, as effective immediately we are operating with the guidance that all travel is not essential; therefore all travel requires prior authorization from CEO and must be client-initiated.
  -	March 4, 2020:  
  -*	Our leadership has canceled their March/Spring break trips to personally prioritize the safety of our families and our broader Klick family. While we can’t demand that all Klicksters do so as well, we request that you consider the increased risk as this situation unfolds. 
  -*	We are immediately implementing the CDC recommended self-quarantine practices for anybody that is completing travel outside of North America. 
  -*	In addition, we request that any travel outside of work, internationally, or within North America, is disclosed to our travel team for safety and tracing purposes. 

-	Facilities:
  -	We will be removing Listerine from washrooms and we encourage everyone to avoid brushing their teeth at work.
  -	As an extra precaution, we will remove any open candy or chips from the office; and we encourage everyone to sanitize their hands before meals. For example, wash hands after getting a chocolate bar from the vending machine as well as before opening your wrapped candy.
  -	We have also put all reusable cutlery and plates in storage and have replaced these with single use items while we are at this level of preparedness.
  -	We are working with our labs team to identify potential digital tools for improving containment further. For example, we’re exploring apps that warn you before you touch your face, as well as thermal imaging requiring no touch, so people can personally choose to verify they don’t have elevated temperatures, without having to handle a thermometer. 
  -	We are in the process of removing all boardroom or meeting room clickers and keyboards. We also encourage you to use the back of a pen on zoom screens or other surfaces and a key or gloves when touching elevator buttons, opening doors, and so on. 

-	Policy Decisions:
  -	We request that you take your laptop home nightly. We are immediately starting to transition closer towards remote-work in order to prioritize the safety of our team and prepare for the possibility of school or public transportation interruptions.
  -	No handshakes. No hugs. We would add that it’s sensible to avoid shaking hands entirely to reduce the risk of spreading infection. Though that might be awkward at times, please recognize that these are unique times and require these precautions.
  -	_*IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING WELL, YOU MUST WORK FROM HOME (if you are able) AND YOUR OBLIGATION IS NOT TO ATTEND OUR OFFICES. WE MUST PRIORITIZE ASKING FOR EVERYONE TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THIS POLICY FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL KLICKSTERS.*_
  -	We are canceling these events:
  -*	Dr. Seuss Experience family event in Toronto
  -	Effective immediately, we are also pausing:
  -*	Klick Tavern
  -*	Yoga and Wellness classes are postponed. The gym will remain open to ensure shower access, as we encourage people to bike into work and use the showers, but we highly discourage hygiene activities like tooth brushing or shaving in these shared facilities. Likewise, we discourage the use of gym equipment. 
  -*	Mojo Meetings
  -*	Pizza Wednesday (and any food-related activities)
  -	For March, we’re moving the following meetings to virtual sessions and we’ll be reassessing for April: 
  -*	Science Sessions 
  -*	Breakfast Meetings 

-	Guidance to our team:
  -	We highly encourage our team to avoid large public gatherings, including concerts and sporting events.
  -	We highly recommend that family vacations involving travel, hotels, parks, or other large gatherings also be deferred.
  -	We are defining large gatherings as 25 or more people, but we trust our leaders' judgement. While we are unable to control our client’s guidance to their teams, we can prevent Klicksters from creating these situations ourselves.

-	New Procedures:
  -	Attached below, please find the FAQ that will be a living document, designed to help clarify and answer your questions as the situation continues to unfold.
  -	Our department heads have been asked to share information with respect to remote work business continuity and over the coming days, we will begin to implement localized stress testing of our continuity. 
  -	We are instituting a standing COVID-19 Lunch Q&A Session and for obvious reasons this will be a virtual meeting. These meetings will begin on Monday, March 9, 2020.

## Level 4+ (ZERO Air Travel)
-	While we are not at this point today, we expect there is a high probability we will be terminating all air travel (including domestic).

## Level 4++ (ZERO In-person Client Meetings)
-	While we are not at this point today (because we can’t control the protocols being deployed in other organizations), we anticipate that we may need to cease in-person client meetings.

## Level 5 (School Closures)
-	In the event of a location-specific government or school-specific decision to close schools, we recognize that some parents will need to work remotely to accommodate. We will have our remote working protocols implemented. Please contact your managers to let them know. 
  -	Given that these protocols were already triggered in China and Italy, as well as beginning in some localized areas of the US as of March 4, 2020; we need to be prepared. 
-	We recommend making conditional childcare arrangements in the interim:
  -	Kids & Company resources for Canadian employees
  -	EAP in both US and Canada as a resource for sourcing childcare
-	We are currently working on plans for how to minimize the impact on our ability to collaborate/deliver on client expectations.

## Level 6 (Public Transportation Closures)
-	We encourage everyone to follow public health guidelines and be especially vigilant using public transportation. In China, many of the community cases occurred as a result of people touching surfaces that had previously been occupied by an infected person. Please exercise caution, wash hands regularly, and avoid eating on public transportation. 
-	If you cannot make it to work because of a public transportation disruption, please work from home.

## Level 7 (Employee Infected with COVID-19)
-	While we are hopeful that with all of these precautions we will avoid having a Klickster become infected, we will be developing our protocols for containment, tracing, and communication over the coming days.
-	Mandatory work from home for entire local office
-	Notify respective property manager (Choice Properties, WeWork, or Knotel)
-	Notify non-Klick contacts
-	Third party professional sanitization of our offices
-	Expert advice regarding reopening our offices

## *Level 8 (Shift to Remote Work/Work from Home for a Significant Portion of Klicksters)*
-CURRENT STATUS (Effective March 8, 2020)*
-	We will be working with experts on ensuring we are as prepared as possible. 
-	The range of decisions surrounding the technology enabling our teams to remotely work, on-premises dependencies, departments with assets requiring on-site servers, telephony, office VPN capabilities, and many typically interactive experiences such as onboarding; would be materially impacted.
-	All of our business continuity plans are currently being adapted in response to COVID-19 and we’re carefully evaluating our protocols, as well as reassessing plans daily.

## Level 9 (Office Closure)
-	If we close our facilities, this would materially impact many of our shared services functions, as well as logistics, deliveries, physical mail, and printing. These plans are also evolving.

## FAQ General 

### a.	How do we access the recorded daily company zoom call?
We are posting the Zoom recordings each day on the internal landing page we created on Genome for COVID-19 updates.

We will be updating it on a regular basis. 

###c.	Are all Klicksters expected to attend all of the daily zoom updates?
It is totally opt-in. We are holding daily updates to help ensure that everybody has a mechanism to get answers to questions daily but ultimately, attendance is up to you. We are recording the daily updates so you can also stay up to date by reviewing them later in the day if you are unable to join the live zoom.

### d.	Since we are Level 8, does that mean an employee has been diagnosed with coronavirus (Level 7)? If so, which office was impacted?
-	No, as of March 9, we do not have anyone who has been diagnosed. Our offices are open but we are encouraging you to work from home out of an abundance of caution given the rapidly evolving public health situation. The Levels do not always fall in sequential order, especially those that are determined by government control (e.g. school closures or public transportation).

-	Yes, effective March 9, we are hosting a daily virtual company meeting to ensure that our team is up to speed on any new developments and has the opportunity to ask any questions that you may have.

### h.	For any upcoming inter-office travel that the Travel Team booked before these restrictions, should we initiate cancellation in Genome? Or is that being handled automatically?
-	Over-communication is always better. Please reach out to them

### i.	I noticed all of our cups have been collected and placed in temporary storage, including our personal mugs. How will we get them back?

-	Some of our floors have lights with motion sensors and will automatically turn on while others require you to call a number and enter a code. For more details and instructions, please go to: https://genome.klick.com/page/facilities/office-lights/ for.

### k.	Will Reception still be open this week?
-	Yes, our offices are currently open even though effective March 9, we are encouraging our team to work from home. We are looking into various Reception solutions in the event of an office closure.

### l.	If I incur expenses while working from home will I be able to claim “work space in the home expenses” for tax purposes?
-	We’re working hard to ensure that employees don’t personally incur material additional business expenses by working from home. We have determined that Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has very specific qualifications in order to make a claim for tax purposes. See their guidance here. In short, unfortunately, we don’t expect any team members to qualify so, at this time, we don’t anticipate issuing any T2200 forms for “Declaration of Conditions of Employment” to support such a claim. U.S. employees likely have a similar challenge supporting this kind of tax claim from the IRS and State governments. That said, we’re getting expert tax advice on this to give the best possible guidance.

### m.	What is the success criteria for us to be returning to 'normal' work and social interactions at Klick?
-	Much like our decision to encourage you to work from home ahead of the curve, our success criteria will be based on ensuring your health and safety above all. We’ll be taking direction from the WHO and CDC with respect to resuming “normal” work operations.

## FAQ Team Meetings
### a.	Can I still have team meetings?
-	Yes. We ask that out of office colleagues participate over Zoom. We are trying to limit non-essential travel. 

### b.	What is Klick’s stance on after-hours events? Can I still socialize with my team after working hours?
-	We love and encourage Klicksters socializing. However, given the rapid evolution of this situation, we ask that you consider pushing pause for the time being as we see how this plays out. 

### c.	Can I still have team events? (i.e. do we push pause on proactive prevention?)
-	We love and encourage team events. However, given the rapid evolution of this situation, we ask that you consider pushing pause for the time being as we see how this plays out. 

### d.	Can I still have team events if all of my team is local? (i.e. all in NY, Toronto, or Philadelphia?) 
-	We love and encourage Klicksters socializing. However, given the rapid evolution of this situation, we ask that you consider pushing pause for the time being as we see how this plays out. 

## FAQ Personal Travel
### a.	What is our expectation here?
- We understand that you may have personal travel plans in place, especially with March/Spring break around the corner.  If you will be traveling domestically or internationally by way of major transportation hubs, please be vigilant and ensure you are aware of travel advisories. Please note that via an abundance of caution, upon your return, we may ask that you work from home for a period of time. 
-	Effective March 9, in order to protect the vulnerable, if you take personal trips, you MUST subsequently work from home.

### b.	How are we handling employees returning from vacation?
-	Effective March 9, team members returning from a travel-based holiday are required to work from home. also need to self-quarantine

### c.	What should we do if we already have plans for Personal travel outside the country as airlines are charging penalty fees for cancellation?
-	Effective March 9, our recommendation is to defer travel to a time when the current health risk is over. Most airlines will allow deferrals. Unfortunately, we cannot cover personal costs.

### d.	Given that people are starting to cancel trips and vacation plans will there be any consideration from Klick for expanding our vacation carry-over policy to account for this?
-	We still encourage people to use their vacation as earned so that they have opportunities to recharge and benefit from some R&R. 

## 10.	Personal Health
### a.	Do I need to be scared right now? 
-	We understand this is a rapidly evolving situation. We have everyone's best interest in mind and so it is with an abundance of caution that we are taking these precautions. If you are feeling anxious, talk to us or call our Employee Assistance Programs (EAP). 

### b.	If I used all of my sick days and I am feeling unwell, what do I do?
-	We have a standard process in place to help you in these situations - please refer to the Klickster Guide for your location and speak to your manager about any concerns. 

### c.	In the event that any team member is diagnosed with COVID-19, will we be notified to get tested? How will it be handled?
-	Effective March 9, we are encouraging everyone to work from home ahead of the curve to help avoid this situation and we are hopeful that by taking precautions, everyone will remain in good health. That said, if a COVID-19 Positive Case emerges, we will immediately inform the entire organization once confirmed. We will also share which floor and location were affected. To respect people’s personal privacy, we would only be able to name the diagnosed individual with their permission.

### d.	If an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19 and is ill, will that be considered short term disability? From the news, it sounds like some people recover in days and some people take weeks to get better. Will it be a person-by-person basis or will there be a special dispensation for COVID-19 cases?
- 	From what we understand, COVID-19 can take several forms. Some people may have mild symptoms where they’re able to work from home; others may need a few sick days (we offer up to 6 paid sick days per year) to recover; while others may require hospitalization for several weeks. We provide general health insurance to support all employees in each situation. We are in the process of investigating Short-Term Disability Insurance options in the U.S., as U.S. employees currently have no such disability coverage until eligible for Long Term Disability Insurance (after 90 days of disability). In Canada, sick leave beyond 6 days is automatically referred for adjudication to our expert disability management partner firm who will confidentially assess the requirements for Short Term Disability Insurance. Both programs have caps on the benefits they pay out. Please see the links in Genome for more information.

### e.	Do our family and friends need to worry about being in contact with us at this point?
-	We're trying to get ahead of the curve by encouraging everyone to WFH effective March 9 (rather than being reactive later). We think this will make it safer for our team members and our families at home.

## FAQ Technology Equipment

### a.	Can we come in to pick up our monitors/dongles/etc. anytime or is the plan to communicate some sort of schedule to minimize congregation?
-	Yes, our offices are open but effective March 9, we are encouraging people to work from home. We are working on a plan for people to deliver things from the office. We are signaling to organization that we may soon be at Level 9. That said, we are not there yet. Please create a task here if you're taking company equipment home using the link is accessible on the Genome Safety Guidelines & Useful Links page.

### b.	In the event of full office closure (Level 9), will we be able to physically access the office, for example, to pick-up additional hardware or download files from an onsite server.
- No. We anticipate that this could happen imminently. As such, please bring home any important personal items and those that you require for work daily.

### c.	How should we handle devices (e.g. iPads for IVAs) shared by QA and Dev (and sometimes ED) for testing? Will we be stocking additional devices so each employee that may require one, can bring one home with them?
-	 SauceLabs provides a virtualized device service for QA.  We will be providing SauceLabs accounts to anyone that needs access to test devices. For immediate needs, please sign up for a 14 day trial account at https://saucelabs.com/sign-up 
You can use your klick.com or katalyst.com email address.  We will be working out pricing with SauceLabs for longer term licenses over the next week, and will be communicating the process as soon as it is established.  For any questions, please slack Sharmilla Sivasankaran.

### d.	What is the policy regarding work phones? Can we expense our phone bills if we need to make calls to the US to get in contact with vendors/clients?
-	Effective March 9, you will be able to expense specific line items for long distance for client work. We will not cover the cost of an entire mobile phone bill. Please note that Zoom has a 1-800 number that can mitigate most long-distance costs so we ask that you use Zoom whenever possible. We are also working on a potential other telecommunications solution and will keep you posted.

### e.	If we'll be WFH for an extended period of time, is there any chance we may be able to expense part of our Internet bill?
-	Effective March 9, if you do not normally WFH and need to upgrade your current Internet plan to unlimited to handle the increased usage for client work, we will require your previous and next bills so that we can reimburse the incremental cost of unlimited data during this unusual period. Please expense to the following cost center for tracking shortly: covid19 - Unlimited Internet.

### f.	Can we get documentation for VPN usage…a “How to Guide” to help those who do not have experience using a VPN?
-	The link is accessible on the Genome Safety Guidelines & Useful Links page.

### g.	Is our Klick Office VPN different then the VPN that is being rolled out (as mentioned in the information session) or is that the same VPN but being rolled out to more people?
-	The link is accessible on the Genome Safety Guidelines & Useful Links page.

### h.	How can I access a Veeva CRM installation file for Windows 10? Is there a folder location for these installation files that I need access to?
-	We are working on implementing this plan and will keep you posted. 

### i.	Will we get access to the Office servers through VPN or should we upload everything to GDrive?
-	We recommend moving files that you use regularly to GDrive, but the VPN solution will allow access to office servers.

### j.	For the COVID-19: Monitor/Accessory Loan task template, are we allowed to bring home and borrow our office chairs (if we can transport it home)?
-	The link is accessible on the Genome Safety Guidelines & Useful Links page.

### k.	After I put the task in to take home equipment, when can I come pick it up? Will there be a notification of some sort?
-	As indicated in the task template, the task is only for tracking purposes. Once submitted, you can pick-up your equipment at any time!

### l.	Can I use Uber to transport my monitor home even though the company does not cover Uber for commuting?
-	Yes, first please reach out to the Travel team, let them know what items you are taking home and then you will be able to expense that trip.

### m.	For those of us who live a substantial distance from the office, it may be less expensive to buy a new monitor than expense an Uber ride. Is expensing a new monitor possible in this case?
-	This seems reasonable but please check in with our Systems team first for asset tracking. We don’t want to end up buying a load of monitors that we don't need.

### n.	What are the minimum recommended internet speed requirements for working from home?
-	We recommend a high-speed internet with unlimited data. The specific bandwidth throughput requirements we expect to change depending on role requirements. More specifically, clearly some departments might handle much larger files. That said, in most major markets, a standard broadband connection with unlimited data should be sufficient.

### o.	Is there an effective way to have cross-team or client meetings virtually that require whiteboarding? (beyond zoom...)
-	We are working on providing guidelines and implementing solutions to improve whiteboard collaboration. We expect these plans to be ready over the next few days.

## FAQ NYC Office 
### a.	Is the NYC office expansion still happening?
- Yes. We are staying the course and are excitedly looking forward to April as planned. If anything changes we will update accordingly. 
- Effective March 9, we are still working on the plan to open the office. It looks like it will be impacted by people not being able to travel. That said, we look forward to celebrating the opening after the evolving public health situation is under control.
 
## FAQ Possible School Closures
### a.	What do I do if my children's school closes? 
-	See the Level 5 plan of the safety guidelines.

## FAQ Virtual Workshops
### a.	Who can help me deliver virtual workshops?
- Contact the People Practices team for how to run collaborative and virtual workshops at Peoplepractices@klick.com.

## FAQ Travel
### a.	If I can’t fly, what does that mean for trains or any other public transportation? 
-	It is our goal to minimize mass exposure risk. Obviously international airports are high risk, as are the busiest train stations. At this time, it is our goal to reduce the unnecessary portions of this type of travel.

## FAQ Media Inquiries
### a. Can we share this document with the media or do media interviews?
- Our Communications team is happy to share our plan and arrange interviews with the media upon request. We ask that should any media approach you that you connect them with our Comms team at pr@klick.com. That said, please feel free to share https://covid19.klick.com/ with any friends or family members that might be interested in preparing.
